					<h2>culture</h2>
					<p>Culture plays an important role in the development of any nation. It represents a set of shared attitudes, values, goals and practices. Culture and creativity manifest themselves in almost all economic, social and other activities. A country as diverse as India is symbolized by the plurality of its culture.
					</p>
					<p>India has one of the world’s largest collections of songs, music, dance, theatre, folk traditions, performing arts, rites and rituals, paintings and writings that are known, as the ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage’of humanity.

					<h2>art</h2>
					<p>
						Art is nothing but description of the artist's state of mind. It has been used for ages to describe people's emotions, beliefs, thoughts. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class= "colum grid_4">
					<h2>travel</h2>
					<p>
						Travel is important because it fundamentally transforms us. This experience of waking up to the power of your own transformation fires you up to “be the change you want to see in the world,” as Gandhi puts it.
					</p>
					<p>	
						By taking a break from your daily life, unplugging from the pulls and pushes of technology and engaging in new activities in new places, you have an easier opportunity to release unwanted habits. Also, it is empowering to surround yourself with people who don't know the encyclopedia of your past. It reinforces your willingness to broaden your horizons, to get unstuck and to move in new directions.
